SEISAN : Project 2

Seisan is a full stack web application used to categorize and sort the tasks of the user. Users can create a simple login which will take them to a page to create tasks. Each task can be put into a Todo, In-progress, Complete, or Icebox. Once a task is logged in to the appropriate category, a dropdown and delete button is created that will allow movement of the task from one category to the other. 
The Progress button will show two graphs each showing the tasks in each category. The pie chart is interactive and can show the comparasions of each task category upon clicking from the list above. Between the charts shows the level of the user based upon the completed tasks. 

Future Features:
-User Authentication and Sign in through platforms such as Google or FaceBook.
-Projects: These projects can be shown after a user logs in and can contain multiple users. With this feature users can use Seisan as a project board platform. 
-Achievements: With the existing Achievement and User Levels integrated into projects, team members can see they're current rank and as well as the rank of others. This feature will be meant to incentivize users to be more productive. 
-User Ids: In a user's individual tasks the user id will not be required. For projects where there are multiple users, the id will not be required but instead a name will be required. This requirement will be meant for assigning task to oneself or to another teammate and will allow tasks to be passed to another team member.
