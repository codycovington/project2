this is a list of the classes and IDs that connect the front and the back end. 
Logic.js is the script that will send the user input to the back end. logic.js is in main.handlebars instead of each individual files. 
put.handlebars uses all the logic and is now the index page, project, tasks, and user.handlebars are not 100% necessary but we could utilize them in case just one of the tables needs to be accessed.
